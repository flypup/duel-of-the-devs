# Duel to the Devs

A very rough demo can be played [here](http://flypup.github.com/game-off-2012/). It's a [gh-pages](http://pages.github.com/) branch of this repo containing just the distribution files built with [yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman).

## What We Use

* [Chipmunk-js](https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js) 2D physics model
* [EaselJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) SpriteSheet class
* [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js) guess I'm a fan of [@mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob)
* [dat-gui](http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/) for testing and tuning a variety of things
* [three.js](http://threejs.org/) 3D rendering - Didn't make it into this release, but we hope to contribute or at least come up with our own sprite renderer that make it viable for HTML5 games on platforms where WebGL is not available or canvas rendering needs a boost.
