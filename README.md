## Working Title 'Duel to the Devs'

A very rough demo can be played [here](http://flypup.github.com/game-off-2012/). It's a [gh-pages](http://pages.github.com/) branch of this repo containing just the distribution files built with [yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman).

We're also using:
* [Chipmunk-js](https://github.com/josephg/Chipmunk-js) 2D physics model
* [EaselJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) SpriteSheet class
* [three.js](http://threejs.org/) 3D rendering (although you might see a simpler renderer being used)
* [stats.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js) guess I'm a fan of [@mrdoob](https://github.com/mrdoob)
* [dat-gui](http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/) for testing and tuning a variety of things

__Controls__

* Move using WASD/Arrows, gamepad L stick or if you're playing on a touch device, use the virtual L stick
* Push/Pull/Punch using ... TBD
* Shadow Clone ... TBD
